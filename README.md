# Farm Project
For this project I made a farm. Where you can click the animals on the farm and they move.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice
I made this web application with both JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.The user starts with $1,000. When a minimum bet is made, the user can lose up to one dollar or make 25 dollars. When a maximum bet is made the user can make up to 100 dollars or lose 50 dollars. When the user loses the dom is updated with the message of "winner" or "loser".


## Lessons Learned:

While making this web application I further my understanding of how arguments work within a function. Also my understanding of conditionals has increased.


##Changes
I made some color changes to buttons
