# Farm Project
For this project I made a farm. Where you can click the animals on the farm and they move.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice
I made this web application with both JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The user can click on images on the HTML page and the image will move randomly to another position. Also when the image moves it will play a sound.


## Lessons Learned:

While making this web application I further my understanding of how to use .onClick and how Math.random can be used to move images.
